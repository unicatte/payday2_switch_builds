This is the stealth build that's gonna work out on virtually any stealth heist and covers virtually every possible use case. You should use the Broomstick pistol as your takedown method, as it sports high damage which leaves lower chance for guards to fire their guns as you kill them. Alternatively you can use the Raven shotgun to boost bodies into cover. You have a Raven for maintaining high concealment, the loud saw for Stockholm Syndrome and you can use either of the saws for an easier method of opening things like doors or deposits (the latter of which will usually take just one swipe to open).

Stockholm Syndrome is a very underrated skill. As a host if you continuously spam your loud weapon from civs' detection until they lay on the ground you're extremely unlikely to have them misbehave and call or press the panic button. That admittedly gets a little more shakey if you're a guest.

You're equipped with a maxed out drill, fast lockpicking (can be increased by using Burglar) and bag transport skills which are especially helpful for something like narrow windows in the Art Gallery.

Use the pocket ECM to prevent cameras from seeing the bodies until you have the time to loop them or seeing you if you end up forced to stand in its view for too long. You can also equip two types of deployables at the same time. You have normal ECMs to delay pagers and open some electronic doors, body bag cases, and trip mines to mark guards that walk past the sensors. You can also use the unupgraded ammo bag with the saw.

If you don't like Hacker you can replace it with Burglar for faster bagging of bodies, faster pager responses and faster lockpicking.
