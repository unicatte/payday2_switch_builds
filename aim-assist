This build utilizes Body Expertise, Surefire, Overkill and crits, allowing you to deal significant damage to One Down units using the IZHMA without the need to aim for the head. As you place your shotgun shots, your damage gets buffed for a short amount of time which in combination with crits, partial headshot multiplier, sizeable magazine and a fast reload improves your damage per second greatly. It is mostly efficient to keep dealing damage in a continuous manner, as your damage output will ramp up when you do so.

The build hardly requires aim what so ever. Most of the time you only need to look in the general direction of your target, spam aiming down sight and fire. Part of the headshot multiplier is applied to the body here which in combination with the ability to penetrate body armor makes it so aiming for the head is mostly unnecessary unless a Bulldozer is involved.

Your choice of perk deck should prioritize decks that work with the suit. I went with Hacker, as it gives me the chance to stun nearby enemies, heal and improves stealth viability (I'm sporting a highly concealable suppressed shotgun after all). If you prefer, Rogue should work just fine as well.
