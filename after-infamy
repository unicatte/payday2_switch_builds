This build is meant to help you kickstart after Infamy. The best heist for this is Rats on Overkill difficulty.

Suit dodge is your best bet on level 0. No armor is available at this point. Your weapons reward high accuracy and having no melee allows you to cancel reloads easily and quickly.

I chose Rogue instead of Hacker so I'm suited to fight Captain Winters with frag grenades and that's what you'll eventually have to do in an online game of Rats. Once you're out hit up the throwable case to regain three grenades.
